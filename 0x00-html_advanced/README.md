# TASK


* 0. Create your first webpage
     Create your first HTML file 0-index.html with:
       * Add the doctype on the first line (without any comment)
       * After the doctype, open and close a html tag
       * Add the language tag, specify English for ISO language code and add the direction tag (ltr or rtl) on the html tag.
       * Open your file in your browser (the page should be blank)
  W3C won’t pass - you can ignore it.
* 1. Structure your webpage
      Copy the content of 0-index.html into 1-index.html
      Create the head and body sections
         * inside the html tag, create the head and body tags (empty) in this order
